Programming Concepts
Variables:
- In programming, data is stored in containers
- When assinging data, the correct container must be used
- Example: Gender and Age
		char gender (container);
		int age (container);
		gender = 'M';
		age = 21;

Standard Input/Output:
- Input would use scanf();
- Output would use printf();
- Example: Asking someone's gender and age
		char gender;
		int age;
		printf("What is your gender?");
		scanf("%c", &gender);

		printf("What is your age?");
		scanf("%i", &age);

		printf("Your gender is %c and you are %i years old", gender, age);

Selection:
- Decision making times
- if(), if else(), else
- Example 1: Whether John needs to go to work
		char sick;
		printf("Is John sick?");
		scanf("%c", &sick);

		if (sick == 'Y')
		{
			printf("John does not need to go to work.");
		}
		
		else
		{
			printf("John needs to go to work.");
		}

- Example 2: Whether John needs to go to work, and if he's sick, goes to hospital or clinic
		char sick;
		char condition;
		printf("Is John sick?");
		scanf("%c", &sick);

		if (sick == 'Y')
		{
			printf("John does not need to go to work.");
			printf("\nIs John very sick?");
			scanf("%c", &condition);

			if (condition == 'Y')
			{
				printf("John needs to go to a hospital.");
			}
			
			else
			{
				printf("John can go to a hospital or a clinic.");
			}
		}
		
		else
		{
			printf("John needs to go to work.");
		}

Loop:
- repeatingly executing the same action
- checking a condition until it is true or false
- while(), for()
Example: Guessing a random number
	int rand_x;
	int input;
	int d = 0; /* To initialise loop */
	
	srand( (unsigned) time(NULL)); 
	rand_x = rand()%101; 
	
	while (d < 1)
	{
		printf("\nGuess the random number between 0 to 100:");
		scanf("%i", &input);
	
		if (input > rand_x)
			printf("The guessed number is larger than the random number.");
		
		else if (input < rand_x)
			printf("The guessed number is lesser than the random number.");
		
		else
		{
			printf("Congratulations! You've guessed it right! The random number is indeed %i.", rand_x);
			break;
		}
	}

Array:
- similar to declaring a variable, only difference is that you add a [] behind the variable name (e.g. int array[10];).
- an array's first position is 0, not 1.
- loops are commonly used when dealing with arrays.
Example: Printing number 20 to 1 and printing one specific number
	int array[20];
	int counter;
	int plus = 1;

	for(counter = 0; counter <= 19; counter++)
	{
		array[counter] = plus;
		printf("\n%i", array[counter]);
		plus++;
	}

	printf("\nThe number in the 6th position in the array is %i", array[5]);
